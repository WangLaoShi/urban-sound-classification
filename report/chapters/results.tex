\section{Results and final remarks}
\label{results}

This last Section shows the results obtained on the different 
test sets and possible improvements.

\subsection{Test set results}
The final model selected is the last one found on previous Section, 
found by the Grid Search.
As stated on the first Section, the five test sets are made out of the 
folds number 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. 

The following are the results on those folds:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |l|r| } 
        \hline
        Test set & Accuracy\\
        \hline
        Fold 5 & 0.6731 \\
        Fold 7 & 0.6301 \\
        Fold 8 & 0.7184 \\
        Fold 9 & 0.6630 \\
        Fold 10 & 0.6906 \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Finally, the mean accuracy and standard deviation for the test sets are: 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |r|r| } 
        \hline
        Mean accuracy & Standard deviation\\
        \hline
        0.6750 & 0.0293 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
